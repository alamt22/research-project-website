	<h1>Automatically Formulating Research Questions Yielding High Probabilities of Making Groundbreaking Scientific Discoveries</h1>
	<div id="wrap">

	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	<p>This project addresses the problem of generating research questions that yield the highest probability of resulting in groundbreaking scientific discoveries when investigated. Given that many groundbreaking scientific discoveries in the current age are interdisciplinary, this project aims to connect together various scientific disciplines in its generation of research questions. The project’s significance relies on the fact that while global scientific output has been increasing exponentially, the production of textbooks and other organized knowledge structures have been unable to keep up with this growth of knowledge, especially in interdisciplinary topics. This widens the gap between textbooks and cutting edge knowledge. Also, this project contains relevance to various other problems such as automatic theorem proving, as this project's methodology provides a methodology of creating novel terms--the primary difficulty in automatic theorem proving. In summary, the project relies on an algorithmic approach to browsing through articles, ranking them by their hirsch index and other impact factors, utilizing term frequency–inverse document frequency to extract scientific terms, building a concept map utilizing tensor calculus, and recursively formulating a research question using graph theory from these extracted scientific terms. When run on historical data, the algorithm successfully predicts 40% of future research projects. Not only does this project formulate a novel approach to the problem of generating research questions and generate concept maps of previous scientific discoveries, but its entire conceptual framework is novel to begin with, modifying several well-known machine learning and graph theory algorithms.</p>

	<h2>Question Examples</h2>
	<p>The following are "good" and "bad" question examples generated by the project. "Bad" questions are those which link two disparate fields that have an irrelevent connection, or those that generate nonsensical questions.</p>

	<h3>Good Questions</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Cancer is one of the leading fatal diseases worldwide with high risk control if early discovered. In computational phylogenetics, tree alignment is a computational problem concerned with producing multiple sequence alignments. Find the relation between cancer and tree alignment. Potential Answer (Path): Cancer->gene sets->gene expression->input trees->tree alignment</li>

		<li>Heart conditions that include diseased vessels, structural problems, and blood clots. Protein coding sequences are DNA sequences that are transcribed into mRNA and in which the corresponding mRNA molecules are translated into a polypeptide chain. Every three nucleotides, termed a codon, in a protein coding sequence encodes 1 amino acid in the polypeptide chain. Investigate the relationship between heart disease and protein coding. Potential Answer(Path): Heart disease -> disease prediction -> intron divergence -> type intron -> protein coding</li>

		<li>Sentiment analysis is the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information. A spam tweet is any tweet that is highly irrelevant and useless to the user it is being sent to. Find the relation between Sentiment analysis and spam tweets. Potential Answer (Path): Sentiment analysis->sentiment polarity->twitter sentiment->tweet level->spam tweets</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Bad Questions</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Heart disease is heart conditions that include diseased vessels, structural problems, and blood clots. A translucent lightpath consists of two or more partial transparent lightpaths ( henceforth called sub-routes or segments).  Find the relation between heart disease and lightpath routing. Potential Answer (Path): Heart disease->internet things->tactile internet->high reliability->lightpath routing</li>

		<li>Cancer is a disease in which abnormal cells divide uncontrollably and destroy body tissue. and apply its characteristic to another image. Color transfer is a practical method to change the appearance of a source image according to the color pattern of a target image. Find the relation between cancer and color transfer. Potential Answer (Path): cancer->gene sets->input functions->color theme->color transfer</li>

		<li>Big Five traits are: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism. Sunday is the day of the week before Monday and following. Saturday Investigate the relationship between Big Five and Sunday. Potential Answer(Path): Big Five -> Personality -> Behavioral Patterns -> Week -> Weekdays -> Sunday</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Overall Analysis</h2>

		<figcaption>Fig.4 - The result of manually collecting 5 different historical research paper datasets, running the question generation algorithm on each, and determining manually how many of these generated questions are actual research projects. The overall average predictive ability is at 40%.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>If a different approach were taken where instead of utilizing a pre-trained BERT networked combined with NLP algorithms, a network itself is trained from the ground-up to generate questions, the predictive ability may increase. Furthermore, the generated questions are only guaranteed to be groundbreaking due to the articles fed into the algorithm having a high average hirsch-index per author. There could be a better metric for the selection of articles instead of average hirsch-index.</p>
